-- scheduled job that:
-- Compares the current values in SEWERAI_INSPECTIONS_V to the latest posted row in EPSEWERAI_CR_INSPECT for the same inspection.
-- If either ASSET_NUMBER or ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION changed and INSPECTION_SID IS NOT NULL, then update that latest feed row’s FEED_STATUS to UPDATED 
-- (and, optionally, refresh those two fields to the current values from the view).
-- If INSPECTION_SID is NULL, it does nothing (i.e., “waits”); on a future run when INSPECTION_SID becomes not null, it will apply the update.
